    <h2 class="title">Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Code the Block is a Kansas City based non-profit that teaches comprehensive educational curriculum that takes students from introduction of a specialized skill set through employment. Our initial focus is developing tech talent in Kansas City, which lacks the workforce to fill the market.</p>
    <h3 class="title">Mission</h3>
    <p>To accelerate growth of the tech and startup community through comprehensive educational programs.</p>
    <h3 class="title">Our Solution</h3>
    <p>A comprehensive approach is vital because it creates a clear path to success that minimizes the chances that a student becomes overwhelmed, frustrated and quits. Most marketable skills, programming in particular, are complex with lots of options about where to start and where to go next. If we can provide a clear learning path and take them all the way to employment and insure time spent studying produces the best results, we can eliminate distraction. Thus, increasing the number of successes and create an empowering educational experience.</p>
